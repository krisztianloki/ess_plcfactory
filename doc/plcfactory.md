## Overview

PLC Factory is a Python script that automates some of the tasks associated with programming PLCs. Concretely, it processes template files and creates TIA Portal files or EPICS database records that contain device information and other information, which may even be dynamically calculated. Thus, PLC Factory eliminates a large part of the potentially tedious and error-prone work associated with programming PLCs.


## Requirements

PLC Factory requires:

- Python 2.7
- Python library `requests` 2.10.0, provided in `/libs`

In addition, the user needs to have read-access to CCDB. Lastly, this application has been developed on Apple OSX. It should run without modifications on any POSIX-compliant operating system, but may not work as intended on non-POSIX-compliant operating systems. Non-POSIX-compliant operating systems included some versions of Microsoft Windows.


## Template file format

Template file names have to have the extension `.txt`. Note that the filename, without the extension, has to end with an integer, which can be separated from the required keyword `TEMPLATE` with an underscore (`_`), e.g. `VALVE_TEMPLATE_TIA-MAP.txt`.

Example template files are provided in the folder `/sample_templates`.


## Files

PLC Factory consists of the following files:


- `plcfactory.py`
- `glob.py`
- `ccdb.py`
- `levenshtein.py`
- `processTemplate.py`
- `plcf.py`
- `plcf_ext.py`

- `README.md`
- `doc/plcfactory.md`
- `doc/plcf.md`



## Usage

The invocation of the script follows the pattern:

`python plcfactory.py --device <device-name> --template <template ids>`

It is possible to use shorthands for the parameters:

`python plcfactory.py -d <device-name> -t <template ids>`

For instance, `python plcfactory.py -d LNS-LEBT-010:Vac-PLC-11111 -t TIA-MAP TIA-DEVICES`.

Execution of the script ends with writing an output file to the directory `/output`.


## Outline

PLC Factory performs the following steps (pseudocode) for each of the provided template IDs, in order:

1. Look up `<device-name>` either in CCDB (first access) or in-memory

2. Determine which devices `X` are controlled by `<device-name>`

3. initialise a set `toProcess`, populated with all devices that are controlled by `<device-name>`

4. while `toProcess` is not empty:

  * remove one element `x`,

  * process template with id `i` associated with `x`, if available

  * add devices controlled by `x` to `toProcess`, but only if they have not yet been processed

  * remove `x` from `toProcess`

5. Process header file associated with `<device-name>`

6. Process footer file associated with `<device-name>`

7. Write one output file according to specification in header file

## Some features

### Processing trees of arbitrary depth

The dependencies that are defined between devices as `controls` and `controlBy` relationships in CCDB are interpreted as trees. PLC Factory can take any device `X` in this tree as an input parameter, and will exhaustively process the entire subtree of which `X` is the root element.


### Flexbile handling of properties

Instead of looking up property names that are provided in a PLCF expression in template files (see `doc/plcf.md` for further information), the lookup happens in reverse, i.e. first all properties that are associated with the current device are looked up in CCDB. Afterwards, each such property is evaluated to its corresponding value if it appears in the current PLCF# expression. The reasoning behind this approach is that it leads to great flexibility as it makes it possible to define any property in CCDB, whose value will be correctly used when processing template files as long as both the property name in CCDB and the property name in the associated template file match.


### References to property values in parent nodes

In order to minimize CCDB maintenance, it is possible to specify that a property value of a device `X` should refer to a property value of a device `Y` with which it is in a `controlBy` relationship, according to CCDB. The substitution is recursive, meaning that if the parent device does not have the desired property, the parent's parents will be evaluated, and so on, until a matching property name is encountered.

The benefit of this approach is that it greatly simplifies maintaining information of devices that use property values that are also present in a parent node. For instance, if device `X` controls `n` devices, which all share one particular property of `X`, then this property has to be defined only once in CCDB for device `X`, and not once for device `X` and `n` times for all devices this device controls.

In order to make use of this ability of PLC Factory, tag a property as follows: `^(<property>)`, e.g. `[PLCF# ^(PropertyString02)]`. This means that there will be no lookup for `PropertyString02` for the current device `X`, but for all devices `X` is controlled by, directly or indirectly, until one device is encountered for which a corresponding entry for `PropertyString02` exists in CCDB.


### Global handling of counter variables

In order to remove the tedium of manually specifying values that dynamically change, it is possible to make use of up to `9` counter variables in template files, `Counter1` to `Counter9`. After all template files have been processed, a final pass is performed that assigns correct values to all counter variables in the temporary data before creating the output file. The starting value for both counters is `0`.

Keep in mind that every counter is implicitly (!) initialised to `0`, meaning that the starting value does not need to be provided by the user. If you want to increase the value of a particular counter, you need to increment it in the header file. For instance, the line `#COUNTER Counter1 = [PLCF#Counter1 + 1];` expresses that the counter `Counter1` is set to `1`. It is implicitly initialised to `0`, but then its value is incremented by `1`.



### Custom file name

In order to create a custom filename for the output file, a header file needs to be provided. It has to contain, as the very first line, a definition of the desired name for the output file. The expected format is as follows:

`#FILENAME [PLCF#INSTALLATION_SLOT]-[PLCF#TEMPLATE]-[PLCF#TIMESTAMP].scl`

Note that certain characters in the resulting file name may get changed if they are not allowed in file names by the underlying operating system. For instance, on OSX, the colon (`:`) sign is turned into a slash (`/`).

The definition needs to start with `#FILENAME`. The following four keywords are implemented:

`INSTALLATION_SLOT`: installation slot taken from the invocation of `plcfactory.py`

`DEVICE_TYPE`:       device type retrieved from CCDB

`TEMPLATE`:          template number; taken from provided argument

`TIMESTAMP`:         date and time of programm invocation, using current system time

In order to add further fields, modify the function definition of `createFilename()` in the file `plcfactory.py`.

You can choose any file extension you want, and even omit an extension altogether.


### Consistency check via Hashing

PLC Factory is able to compute a checksum that records whether a change in the relevant data stored in CCDB has taken place. The corresponding tag is `#HASH`, which is to be placed in a header file. If this tag is present, it will be replaced by a signed 32-bit value. In order to compute this value, all devices and properties in a subtree of which the argument `device-name` is the root are retrieved, recursively sorted in alphabetical order and turned into a string. The resulting string serves as the input of the chosen hash function (`CRC32`), which maps any input to one of `2^32` outputs. Note that because the input space is infinite, but the output space finite, hash collisions may occur. This means that two different inputs may result in the same output (recall the 'Birthday Problem'). In practice, this should not be an issue, but it may be worthwhile pointing out that hash functions that take unbounded inputs cannot guarantee uniqueness of outputs.


### Switching to CCDB-Test

PLC Factory is primarily used in conjunction with CCDB, which is a production system. However, it is also possible to use the test database CCDB-Test. This is possible by providing the argument `--test` when invoking PLC Factory. Note that an additional argument `--production` has been implemented as well. The argument `--test` overwrites `--production`, though. In fact, `--production` has no effect at all as it is simply ignored since the default database is `CCDB`. Both arguments are provided in case the user desires either symmetry or explicitness, for instance when invoking `PLC Factory` in a shell script.



## For advanced users

### Adding keywords

Look for the following lines of code is `plcf.py`:

	def keywordsHeader(filename, device, n):
	    assert isinstance(filename, str)
	    assert isinstance(device,   str)
	    assert isinstance(n,        int)

	    timestamp  = '{:%Y%m%d%H%M%S}'.format(datetime.datetime.now())
	    deviceType = ccdb.getDeviceType(device)

	    # dictionary of the form key: tag, value: replacement
	    substDict = {'INSTALLATION_SLOT': device
	                ,'TEMPLATE'         : 'template-' + str(n)
	                ,'TIMESTAMP'        : timestamp
	                ,'DEVICE_TYPE'      : deviceType
	                }

In order to add a new keyword, add a new entry to `substDict`. You may need to provide the corresponding value as a function argument.



### Scaling behaviour

PLC Factory is rather efficient. The bottleneck of the execution is due to input/output operations like accessing CCDB via the network, downloading template files, opening those files, and writing the final output.

PLC Factory runs in `O(m + n) = O(n)`, where `m` is the number of device types, of which there is one template associated with each device type. Furthermore, `n` is the number of devices. CCDB needs to be accessed once for every device in a dependency tree. Internal operations are disregarded in this calculation; writing the final output is interpreted as a constant. As a consequence, PLC Factory is expected to scale linearly, depending on the number of both unique device types and the total number of devices.

Note that processing additional templates is a constant (!) because information regarding the same devices is needed. However, after the first template has been processed, information regarding each affected device has been requested from CCDB once already and is therefore available in-memory.
