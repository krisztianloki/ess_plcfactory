# PLC Factory #

PLC Factory is intended to simplify programming PLCs by automatically generating template files.

TODO:
- clean up repository (will be done at the end)

- implement backtracking for properties, so that a template can have a reference to a property of a device it is controlled by

- (?) implement named variables, e.g. counters, in PLCF_Lang
