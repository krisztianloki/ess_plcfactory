# PLC Factory
(c) 2016 European Spallation Source, Lund


PLC Factory is intended to simplify programming PLCs by automatically generating template files. It takes an arbitrary device and template name as input and processes the corresponding sub-tree of devices according to their entries in CCDB.

## Quickstart

PLC Factory requires Python 2.7.

Invocation follows the pattern `python plcfactory.py --device <device> --template <ids>`, where `ids` is a list of template names of at least one element.

Sample invocation:
`python plcfactory.py --device LNS-LEBT-010:Vac-PLC-11111 --template EPICS-DB TIA-MAP`

With shorthands:
`python plcfactory.py -d LNS-LEBT-010:Vac-PLC-11111 -t EPICS-DB TIA-MAP`

The resulting output file will be written to `\output`.


For further information, see `\doc`.
